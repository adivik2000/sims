<br />
<p>An orphaned intervention is an 
intervention that has not yet been ended <br />
that has also gone past the end date,  <br />
has one or more participants that cannot access the student,  <br />
or has no participants at all. </p>

<p>The red fields show why that intervention is considered orphaned.</p>

<p>To end one or more interventions, check the boxes at the left, and then press the "End Selected" Button.  (You may also need to pick a reason.) </p>
<p>You can add participants by selecting them from the dropdown in each intervention row.  The X next to a participant will remove him/her. </p>
<p>You can change the end date by clicking on the icon next to the date and then choosing a new one. </p>
