3564,Number Development Assessment (Interview for Numbers 0 - 100),"The Number Development Assessment Interview is administered individually and used with numbers from 1 - 100.  It is not necessary to administer the entire assessment in one session.  The tool includes text or a script for what to say when administering the tasks.  It is not critical to say exactly what is indicated onthe script, but when variations that provide extra scaffolding for the student are aused (e.g., emphasizing vocabulary, insering adjectives, or gesturing to materials), they shoulc be noted as they may provide information useful for instruction. Numeral identification Strips, Number Sequencing Cards and Dot Cards that are needed for administration can be found in Learning Mathematics in the Primary Grades on pages 23 to 31 and in Learning Mathematics in the Intermediate Grades on pages _ to _.
