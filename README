see deployment for information on how to deploy.    This will be centrally hosted, but you're welcome to set up your own instance and help contribute code.


Note: There are some required gems for testing.  To see them set the RAILS_ENV to test:
rake  gems RAILS_ENV=test


Be sure to set the domain name of the SIMS application in the config/initializers/host_info.rb file to send the proper links in emails generated by the application.
