need way for sims to import from districts
   students
   system flags (or data to create them)
   student groupings


need way for sims to export
   ??? 
   Wisconsin Longitudinal System???
   Other student information systems


first round
csv bulk update (all at once)
csv required fields, any order


goals.   be able to import

student- , firstname, lastname, id_state or id_district  id_state needed for interdistrict xfer  DOB, ESL, special_ed


enrollment grade, school (id_district or id_state), student (id_district or id_state)
flags


1. upload students.csv
process students.csv          edit existing records if there are changes, add new ones, delete (unset district) remainder


2. upload file.zip containing students.csv
process students.csv

3. process file.zip asynchronously,  don't tie up browser session

4. process upload of file.zip asynchronously

5. add enrollments.csv to zip

6. add extended_profiles.zip





A district admin should be able to
upload a zip file containing students.csv  password zip file?



give  each district them ssh cert, user?
job scp's zip file district.zip to home directory    
poll filesystem and look for changes,   or some other scp hook
give ssh key or cert for unattendended xfer
encryption, unattended, asynchronous
email if problems

neg
pain to setup and maintain,  needs vendor buyin (potentially)











   


processing large files
ideas

could be offloaded to another server
look at field order in csv
get another csv from db in same order
sort original csv in same order as db server
do diff
handle insertions, deletions and updates from diff file


--------------- File formats
students.csv   id_state, id_district, first_name, last_name, [middle_name], [suffix], birthdate, number


enrollments.csv student_id_state, school_id_state, grade, [year]


notes
[middle_name] [suffix] not currently in SIMS, will probably need to be added.

[year]  we'll need a way to distinguish enrollments by year, staff may need to work with their current set of students, or the next set of students
