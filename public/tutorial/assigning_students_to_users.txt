associating users with students.

Make sure users, students, and enrollments have been entered.
The User must have the "Regular User" Role checked.


1. Give the user access to all students in the district.

As a district admin go to the edit user screen.   Check the box for All Students in District and hit save.

Populate the all_students_in_district.csv file with their appropriate district_user_id

2. Give the user acesss to all students in a school.
As a district admin go to the edit user screen.   Click on the add user school association and make sure the dropdown for "All Students" is set to yes.

Populate the all_students_in_school.csv file with their appropriate district_user_id and district_school_id.

3. Create groups and assign users and students to them.
See *Assigning a school administrator* if you have not yet set one up.

As a school admin pick your school and then go to the groups screen.    You can create a group here and assign it a name and a district_group_id.     Groups most commonly map to sections of students, but are
simply any named association of students (so they could be neighborhoods, teams, or just a way to assign specific students to specific users.)  Then assign users and students by following that link.  Groups 
can also be assigned principals.

You can assign a user to all students in a given grade on the groups screen.  

For grade groupings you use all_students_in_school.csv but populate the grade field.  If the user is a principal (for a school) or an assistant principal (for a subgroup) then set the principal field to true.

Groups are created in the groups.csv
Students are assigned to groups in student_group_assignments.
Users are assigned to groups in user_group_assignments. 

If you are creating your own groups or merging two or more sets (such as sections and neighborhoods) then I recommend adding a prefix to the primary key for those groups in your SIS.  That way if you have a
a neighborhood and a section with the same ID they won't overlap.
