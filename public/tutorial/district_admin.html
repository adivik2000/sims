		<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
		<p>Be sure users have the proper role assigned.  For access to SIMS they need to be a regular user.  They also need to be assigned to students and schools.   If you do not setup groups, then be sure to give your users access to all students in district or all students in school.   You can see successful and failed login attempts from the menu at the left.
