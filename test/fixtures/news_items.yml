one:
  text: system admin is admin.admin.admin.sims-demo.vegantech.com    (administration is done by district)  This will probably not be used anytime soon, since we expect all our districts to be in the United States (and in Wisconsin)   So far you can just set the system news.   The username is district_admin for all the administration districts.  Once there are more districts, users will see a pulldown unless they go to their appropriate subdomain.
