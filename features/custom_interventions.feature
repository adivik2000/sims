  In order to use custom interventions
  A SIMS USER
  Should be able to create and select a custom interventon

    And I select "Some Tier" from "Tier"

    # and anything else that isn't already there or derivable Intervention definition gets created
    # along with intervention using data from intervention and custom flag (intervention, description, title, tier) [user,school, disabled=false]
